# Loyalty Drain Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn to identify key factors influencing customer retention. It includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and visualizations** to help businesses reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **File:** `Loyalty Analysis.csv`
- **Columns:** Customer attributes such as service subscriptions, internet usage, contract type, tenure, payment methods, and churn status.
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

## ðŸ›  Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features.
2. **EDA & Visualizations:** Understanding churn patterns through statistical analysis and graphs.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting the most relevant features for churn analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Customers with month-to-month contracts churn more frequently** than those on long-term contracts.
- **Lack of Tech Support & Online Security increases churn probability**.
- **Senior citizens have a higher churn rate**, requiring targeted retention strategies.
- **Customers using paperless billing and electronic payments churn more often** than those using traditional methods.
- **High monthly charges correlate with increased churn rates**, indicating price sensitivity among customers.
- **Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn**, suggesting early engagement is crucial for retention.
- **Fiber optic internet users have a higher churn rate** compared to DSL users, possibly due to cost concerns or service issues.
